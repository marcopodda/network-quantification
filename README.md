## Code for the article "Efficient Quantification on Large-Scale Networks"

This is the code for the article [Efficient Quantification on Large-Scale Networks](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-025-06915-w) (Machine Learning, Springer, 2025). 

Inside this repository you will find two different implementations:

- `nq` contains the code to run the experiments with LR, WVRN, CDQ, ENQ, and GESN models
- `nq-gnns` contains the code to run the experiments with GCN, GAT, and GIN

Instructions to make them run are contained in README.md files inside the folders.
