## Code for the article "Efficient Quantification on Large-Scale Networks" (submitted)

Inside this repository you will find two different implementations:

- `nq` contains the code to run the experiments with LR, WVRN, CDQ, ENQ, and GESN models
- `nq-gnns` contains the code to run the experiments with GCN, GAT, and GIN

Instructions to make them run are contained in README.md files inside the folders.
